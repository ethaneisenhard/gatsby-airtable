Add the orzo and stir, coating the orzo throughly. Stir occasionally for about 3 minutes or until the orzo is toasty and golden. Add the vegetable broth. Be careful here because the broth will spit and sputter. Bring to a simmer, turn down the heat to low, cover and cook for about 15 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed. Stir. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.\n\nMake the Dressing:\nIn a small bowl add the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Whisk until all the ingredients are emulsified.\n\nPutting it all Together:\nIn the large saute pan, to the orzo, add the veggies and all their juices, stir in the dressing, and feta. Garnish generously with basil and parsley. Serve immediately.","Cooking_Time":20,"Last_Made":"2018-08-22","Rating":10},"fields":{"slug":"/lemon-garlic-orzo-with-veggies/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/lemon-garlic-orzo-with-veggies/","test":"test"}}}
